My repo for the Koding Global Hackathon

### Description

So `DRY` is a pretty universal concept in coding, and one that is especially important for new coders to get a grasp of so as to waste less time while learning.

I wanted to address the idea of teaching someone with basic knowledge of programming constructs the importance of `DRY` vs `WET` code, through an interactive means. This quiz only touches on basic ideas and examples of `DRY` code - not some of the more expansive topics like modular design.

With a little more time it would be fun to make `DRY` vs `DAMP` vs `WET` with even more examples. I think a `CSS` specific set of examples would benifit a lot of folk as well.

### APIs

Didn't end up using any major data APIs for this one - only found out I got into the Hackathon a few days prior, so there wasn't a lot of time to research APIs.

The project is built around Angular, and uses CodeMirror editors.
